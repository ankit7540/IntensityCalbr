# Temperature dependent analysis for pure rotational Raman intensities


The main module is `genC2_PR_T_dep`

[See example](https://github.com/ankit7540/IntensityCalbr/blob/master/PythonModule/determine_C2/rotationalRaman_H2_HD_D2/t_dependent/Example/example.ipynb) for more details on the data required and usage.

This is for analysis where the user provides initial guess values for temperature which is a fit coefficient during the fit process.

For the case where temperature is a fixed parameter, [see other module](https://github.com/ankit7540/IntensityCalbr/tree/master/PythonModule/determine_C2/rotationalRaman_H2_HD_D2/t_independent).
