# Temperature dependent analysis for pure rotational Raman intensities


The main module is `genC2_PR_T_dep`

See example for more details on the data required and usage.

This is for analysis where the user provides initial guess values for temperature which is a fit coefficient during the fit process.


For the case where temperature is a fixed parameter, see other module.
