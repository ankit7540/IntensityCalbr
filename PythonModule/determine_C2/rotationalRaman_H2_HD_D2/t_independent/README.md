# Temperature independent analysis (fixed) for pure rotational Raman intensities

This is for analysis where the user provides **fixed** values for temperature, and this temperature is not changed  during the fit process. Raman intensities are computed at this temperature.

The main module is `genC2_PR_T_fixed.py`.

[See example](https://github.com/ankit7540/IntensityCalbr/blob/master/PythonModule/determine_C2/rotationalRaman_H2_HD_D2/t_independent/Example/example.ipynb) for more details.
