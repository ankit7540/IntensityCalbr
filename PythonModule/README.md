## Python module 

Three modules are given.
 - General scheme where experimental intensities and true intensities are available as 1D array
 - Scheme for rotational Raman intensities from H<sup>2</sup>, HD and D<sup>2</sup>. These are most detailed and include functions for computing the true intensities for a given temperature. If temperature is not needed as a fit variable then computation of spectra at some fixed temperature is also possible.
